Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ronnie Lutalo, a Software Engineer with both Software Development and Project Management experience. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects) involving Full Stack Web Development and Windows Development using C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js/Next.js. Aside from my engineering work, I occasionally work on projects involving Computer Graphics (CG).

Outside work, you might find me cheering for my favorite sports team or [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog) on my [personal website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io) about Software Engineering, Product Development, Visual Arts and more because I generally love sharing with the community.
